<h2> MULTIMODAL DEEP LEARNING  - TENSORFLOW / KERAS</h2>

This repository contains code pertaining to multimodal deep learning classification performed on the SDSS-4 DR-16 dataset. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey captures spectroscopic and photmetric information about the various astronomical bodies such as galaxies, stars and quasars. The dataset consists of both tabular and image data which have been downloaded from the SDSS website. http://skyserver.sdss.org/dr16/en/tools/search/sql.aspx. There are 6 features and 1 target variable for the tabular data. The target variable is a 3 class variable. There are a total of 1000 datapoints. The distribution of the images along with the images of the astronomical bodies (Galaxies, stars and Quasars - In order) is shown below.

<h2> MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS </h2>
Machine learning models have been built using scikit learn library and the pycaret distribution. Tree based classifiers and Gradient Boosting algorithms show higher evaluation metrics than other algorithms but however their performance on class imbalance was not satisfactory. ANNS show better performance on class imbalance and even have higher model metrics. These deep networks are superior to other ML architectures on tabular data.
